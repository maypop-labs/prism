# =============================================================================
# pseudotimeManager.R
# Purpose: Functions for analyzing Monocle3 pseudotime trajectories
# =============================================================================

# This manager has been cleaned up to remove all unused functions.
# The numbered scripts do not import this manager, indicating that
# pseudotime analysis functions are handled directly in the scripts
# or through other manager files.

# Note: All 9 functions were removed as they are not used by any numbered scripts.
# If pseudotime functionality is needed in the future, functions can be
# added back on a case-by-case basis.
